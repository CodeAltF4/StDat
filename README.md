# StDat

This is a personal project.
StDat is a student database system, far from complete at the moment.

Inside the bin folder is the Main.py and other files used for changing, creating or searching in the database.

The StDat.py file is the main file which you start, it will ask for input and when an argument is given it wil start the Main.py with the arguments, when the task is done it should return back to the StDat.py file, except, the StDat.py file does not work.

If anyone has any better ideas on how to fix the issue and make it so that i do not have to type "python Main.py -argument" every time i want to do something, it would be greatly appreciated.

Later in time when the project is nearing completion, the database will not be stored in plain text.

The StDat.py file is not in working use at the moment, working on making a better solution.
