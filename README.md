# DatSto5

This is a personal project.
DatSto5 is a student database system, currently in early development.

Inside the bin folder is files used for changing, creating or searching in the database.

The DatSto5.py file is the main file which you start, it will ask for input and when an argument is given it wil start the appropriate file, when the task is done it should return back to the DatSto5.py file.

I am allways open for ideas and things to improve the program.
