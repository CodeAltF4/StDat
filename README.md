# DatSto5

This is a personal project.
DatSto5 is a student database system, not complete at the moment, but still being worked on.

Inside the bin folder is files used for changing, creating or searching in the database.

The DatSto5.py file is the main file which you start, it will ask for input and when an argument is given it wil start the appropriate file, when the task is done it should return back to the DatSto5.py file.

I am allways open for ideas and things to improve the program.

Later in time when the project is nearing completion, the database will not be stored in plain text, rather in a SQlite database made with python.
